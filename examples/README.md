# Examples

This folder contains minimal example scripts showing how to run the FTDRF simulation.

- `examples/run.py`: small CLI script that runs a simulation and prints norms for each step.

Quick start:

```
# (optional) create and activate venv
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
python -m pip install -e .
python examples/run.py
```

Open `notebooks/experiment.ipynb` with Jupyter to interactively run and plot simulation results.
