Publishing your perturbative quantum formula $ |\psi\rangle_{n+1} = |\psi\rangle_{n} + |\psi\rangle_{n-1}

 |\psi\rangle_{n} $ on GitHub under the MIT License has specific implications: The license is permissive,
granting unrestricted use, modification, distribution, and commercial exploitation, provided the original copyright notice
(e.g., "Copyright (c) [year] [name]") and license terms are preserved in all copies or substantial portions.
Others can copy, modify, merge, publish, sublicense, or sell the software without requiring source code
disclosure for derivatives. In the context of quasiperiodic systems (e.g., Fibonacci quasicrystals),
this promotes collaborative advancements, such as extensions of simulations using QuTiP for topological properties.
Benefits for the author: Wide adoption, increased visibility in the physics community, and disclaimer of liability
(no warranties for functionality or non-infringement). Risks: Potential commercial exploitation without compensation,
creation of "prior art" (hindering patentability), and license incompatibilities with restrictive libraries.
Logically, this supports open science by maximizing reproducibility of the recursive dynamics
(e.g., convergence of occupation probabilities), while maintaining attribution.
