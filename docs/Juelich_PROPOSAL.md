# FTDRF: Short Proposal for Jülich Submission

Summary
- Small research code implementing the Fibonacci Threshold Dyadic Recursive Filter (FTDRF) recurrence and simulation utilities.

Why it fits Jülich
- Focus on quasiperiodic systems and recursive dynamics; small, reproducible experiments; easy to extend for topological or many-body simulations.

Reproducibility
- Deterministic tests (`tests/`) and an executable notebook (`notebooks/validation.ipynb`) demonstrate baseline behavior and parameter scans. Release artifacts and a wheel are available (`v0.1.0`).

Suggested next steps
- Add physics validation against an analytic or literature case.\n- Expand notebooks with parameter sweeps and performance benchmarks.\n- Prepare a short poster or 1‑pager describing results and potential collaborations.
